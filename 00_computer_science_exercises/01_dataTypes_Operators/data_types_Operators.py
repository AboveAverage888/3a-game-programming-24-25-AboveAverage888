# Data Types and Operators, Jackques Williams, v0.0

# Fundamental Data Types
# String - str - Sequence of letters, number, spaces, or other characteristics.
# String in Python are inside  ' ' or " "
#Idc if you use ' ' or " " just be consistent

# Boolean- bool- True or False values

# Float - float - any number value with a decimal including 0, +/-

# Integers - int - any whole number including 0, +/-

# Data Types are stored in VARIABLES.
# A Variable is basically a bucket with a name to put data into.
# VARIABLES NAME SHOULD TELL YOU WHAT DATA IS BEING STORED IN IT.
# VARIABLES CAN'T START WITH A NUMBER
# camelCaseVariablesNames
# snake_case_variables_names

# DECLARING VARIABLES AND ASSIGNING VALUES

high_score = 884654 # int data type

# subtraction

# multiplication
myNum = myInt * myFloat

# Division
myNumber = myInt / myFloat # first is numerator, second is denominator

# MODULUS (MODULO) % --Returns REMAINDER after dividing
# MOST COMMON USE FOR MODULUS IS DETERMINING EVEN / ODD NUMBERS

# COMPARISON OPERATORS


# IS-EQUAL-TO == Are the two values equapl to each other?
# Returns True or False based on evaluation

# Returns True or False based on evaluation
